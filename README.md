# Welcome to EpiTools!

EpiTools is a Python package and associated [napari](https://napari.org/stable/) plugin to extract the membrane signal from epithelial tissues and analyze it with the aid of computer vision.

The development of EpiTools was inspired by the challenges in analyzing time-lapses of growing Drosophila imaginal discs.

The folded morphology, the very small apical cell surfaces and the long time series required a new automated cell recognition to accurately study growth dynamics.

## Installation

The recommended way to install `EpiTools` is via
[pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip)

```sh
python -m pip install epitools
```

To install the latest development version of `EpiTools` clone this repository
